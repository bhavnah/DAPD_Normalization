# DAPD_Normalization
Digital Adjustment of Plant Devopment (DAPD) is a method that sychronize shoot phenotypic measurements. It uses the plant leaf number to normalizes time-series measurements an early developmental stage. This method improves accuracy by decreasing the statistical dispersion of time-series of quantitative traits. Also, it can identify more outliers than any other central tendency technique on the non-normalised dataset.
